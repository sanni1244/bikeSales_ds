<h3>Project Objectives</h3>

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):Conduct a comprehensive EDA to understand the distribution and relationships between variables within the dataset.

Demographic Analysis: Investigate how demographic factors such as marital status, gender, income, education, and occupation correlate with bike purchase decisions.

Socioeconomic Impact: Explore the impact of socioeconomic factors, including income and education, on bike sales.

Geographical Patterns: Examine regional variations to identify if certain areas exhibit higher tendencies for bike purchases.

Age-Related Trends: Analyze age-related patterns to understand if specific age groups are more inclined to buy bikes.

Influence of Car Ownership: Investigate whether the number of cars owned influences the likelihood of purchasing a bike.

Visualization: Create visualizations, such as charts and graphs, to effectively communicate patterns and trends discovered during the analysis.
